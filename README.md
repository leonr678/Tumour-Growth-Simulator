# Tumour-Growth-Simulator
A GUI tumour growth simulation, using Python, that shows the population of cells over time, given input parameters

# Required Libraries

All libraries, except NumPy, are included with Python's standard library:

- ***Tkinter (GUI)***
- ***MatPlotLib***
- ***NumPy***  

# How to use

When the application is run, a window will pop up which will contain text and entries which correspond to the parameters for tumour growth. These are: initial volume, growth rate, duration (days) and maximum volume. When the parameters are confirmed, a graph of tumour volume against time will be plotted, using a logistic model. To reset the application, click the "New parameters" button.
